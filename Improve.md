## Improve
Biohub2.0 is the upgraded version of Biohub, which is the project of team USTC-Software-2016. A lot of functions have been updated and many new features added both at frontend and backend. 

### Frontend
 +**User Interface**: We introduced a new user interface. The beautiful new interface is based on the Bootstrap framework, however, which is highly customized. We disabled the built-in module `Glyphicons` and replace it by `font-awesome`. We coordinated our color schemes and our logo to make a nicer look. Short animations during transitions were added to provide better experience.

 +**Structure**: To improve the user experience, we build Biohub 2.0 as a single page application (or short for SPA), using the advanced MVVM framework Vue.js. Vue.js relies on webpack (not forcibly, but recommended) for pre-compiling, which encapsulating everything into a single file. This is inconvinient for a website with a plugin system, so we analyzed the code generated by webpack and developed an approach to load components dynamically. It is the theoretical basis of Biohub 2.0's plugin system. You can refer to [Main.vue](https://github.com/USTC-Software2017-frontend/Biohub-frontend/blob/master/src/components/plugins/Plugins.vue) to see such mechanism.

### Backend


Biohub 2.0是在biohub1.0的基础上进行了改进升级而完成的项目。
    前端
            我们对Biohub1.0的界面进行了重新设计。 尽管使用了bootstrap框架，但是我们对许多细节进行了调整。 我们去掉了没有必要使用的响应式框架，针对队logo进行了配色的重新挑选。 我们确定了自己的设计风格， 对大部分表单控件进行了重新设计。

            增加了许多切换时加载时的动画，在网络不好的时候不会出现大片的空白。


            使用了ESlint来保证代码风格的统一
            更清晰的项目结构，组件化使项目更好地被分工
